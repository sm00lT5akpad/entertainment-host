        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project showcases a dynamic website for displaying featured movies and series. The home page uses sliders to highlight the top 15 items in each category, while the individual movies and series pages display content in a grid format. Here is a detailed explanation of how the code works:</p>

            <h2>Home Page</h2>
            <p>The home page (`home.html`) utilizes sliders to present the featured movies and series. The content is dynamically loaded and limited to the top 15 items from each category:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML:</strong> Contains the structure for the sliders and links to the individual movies and series pages.</li>
                <li><strong>CSS:</strong> Styles the sliders, including hover effects and shadows to enhance visual appeal.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Fetches content from the `movies.html` and `series.html` files and appends it to the sliders, limiting the display to 15 items each.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Movies and Series Pages</h2>
            <p>The movies and series pages (`movies.html` and `series.html`) display content in a grid format. Each item includes an image, title, description, and a link to detailed information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML:</strong> Contains the structure for the content grid and details sections.</li>
                <li><strong>CSS:</strong> Styles the grid layout, including hover effects and shadows to match the theme.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Dynamically loads content from the respective data files (`movies.js` and `series.js`) and displays it in the grid. Provides functionality to show detailed information when an item is clicked.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Files</h2>
            <p>The data files (`movies.js` and `series.js`) contain arrays of objects representing the movies and series. Each object includes properties such as name, picture, description, and video paths for series episodes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Movies Data:</strong> Contains an array of movie objects with properties like `name`, `picture`, `description`, and `videoPath`.</li>
                <li><strong>Series Data:</strong> Contains an array of series objects with properties like `name`, `picture`, `description`, and `seasons` (which include episodes).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Styling and Theming</h2>
            <p>The visual design of the website follows a dark theme with bright accent colors and shadows to enhance the UI. The shadows and hover effects add a modern and dynamic feel to the elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Colors:</strong> A combination of dark backgrounds with bright accent colors (#0093E9, #00B4DB) is used.</li>
                <li><strong>Shadows:</strong> Elements have shadows to create a floating effect and add depth to the design.</li>
                <li><strong>Hover Effects:</strong> Elements scale up and shadows intensify on hover to provide feedback to the user.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project demonstrates a dynamic and visually appealing way to present movies and series using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code is designed to be modular and easy to extend, making it a solid foundation for further development.</p>
